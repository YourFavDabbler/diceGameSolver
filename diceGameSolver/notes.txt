Arrays
{
    Use indexes to repeat operations with different integers?
    Requires use of arrays
    #include <array>
}

    I have added the header file to include the declarations of the 
    int value and corrected spelling errors

    I also found the following:

           ^^^ "Python reference" ^^^ 
	The reference above only proves that it is 
	possible to insert operations inbetween random 
	integers 1-6 and get a functional expression. 
	Although, it doesn't give a way to compare all 
	the possible outcomes to determine the best if 
	none of the outcomes is exactly the number. I 
	need to find a way to code in a backdoor that 
	will calculate the closest number if an exact 
	number cannot be reached. Along with, coding in 
	exponentiation and roots.
